<!-- SDK reference: telnyx-voice-curl -->

# Telnyx Voice - curl

## Installation

```text
# curl is pre-installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows 10+
```

## Setup

```bash
export TELNYX_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

All examples below use `$TELNYX_API_KEY` for authentication.

## Error Handling

All API calls can fail with network errors, rate limits (429), validation errors (422),
or authentication errors (401). Always handle errors in production code:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TELNYX_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "to": "+13125550001",
  "from": "+18005550101",
  "connection_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}' \
  "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/calls"
```

Common error codes: `401` invalid API key, `403` insufficient permissions,
`404` resource not found, `422` validation error (check field formats),
`429` rate limited (retry with exponential backoff).

## Important Notes

- **Phone numbers** must be in E.164 format (e.g., `+13125550001`). Include the `+` prefix and country code. No spaces, dashes, or parentheses.
- **Pagination:** List endpoints return paginated results. Use `page[number]` and `page[size]` query parameters to navigate pages. Check `meta.total_pages` in the response.

## Operational Caveats

- Call Control is event-driven. After `dial()` or an inbound webhook, issue follow-up commands from webhook handlers using the `call_control_id` in the event payload.
- Outbound and inbound flows are different: outbound calls start with `dial()`, while inbound calls must be answered from the incoming webhook before other commands run.
- A publicly reachable webhook endpoint is required for real call control. Without it, calls may connect but your application cannot drive the live call state.

## Reference Use Rules

Do not invent Telnyx parameters, enums, response fields, or webhook fields.

- If the parameter, enum, or response field you need is not shown inline in this skill, read the API Details section below before writing code.
- Before using any operation in `## Additional Operations`, read [the optional-parameters section](references/api-details.md#optional-parameters) and [the response-schemas section](references/api-details.md#response-schemas).
- Before reading or matching webhook fields beyond the inline examples, read [the webhook payload reference](references/api-details.md#webhook-payload-fields).

```

Primary response fields:

### Webhook Verification

Telnyx signs webhooks with Ed25519. Each request includes `telnyx-signature-ed25519`
and `telnyx-timestamp` headers. Always verify signatures in production:

```bash
# Telnyx signs webhooks with Ed25519 (asymmetric — NOT HMAC/Standard Webhooks).
# Headers sent with each webhook:
#   telnyx-signature-ed25519: base64-encoded Ed25519 signature
#   telnyx-timestamp: Unix timestamp (reject if >5 minutes old for replay protection)
#
# Get your public key from: Telnyx Portal > Account Settings > Keys & Credentials
# Use the Telnyx SDK in your language for verification (client.webhooks.unwrap).
# Your endpoint MUST return 2xx within 2 seconds or Telnyx will retry (up to 3 attempts).
# Configure a failover URL in Telnyx Portal for additional reliability.
```

## Webhooks

Before using any operation below, read [the optional-parameters section](references/api-details.md#optional-parameters) and [the response-schemas section](references/api-details.md#response-schemas) so you do not guess missing fields.
