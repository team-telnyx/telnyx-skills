### Other Agents

For Cursor, Windsurf, and other agents that support the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), copy the desired skill directory to your agent's skills location or reference the `SKILL.md` file directly.

## Skill Structure

Each skill contains a single `SKILL.md` file with:
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata)
- Installation instructions for the SDK
- A setup section with client initialization (shown once)
- Concise code examples for every API operation
- Webhook event reference tables where applicable

All code examples are extracted directly from Telnyx OpenAPI specifications and are guaranteed to work with the latest SDK versions.

## Example

After installing `telnyx-messaging-python`, your AI agent will know how to:

```python
# Setup (shown once at top of skill)
from telnyx import Telnyx
client = Telnyx()

# Send an SMS
response = client.messages.send(
    from_="+15551234567",
    to="+15559876543",
    text="Hello from Telnyx!",
)
```
