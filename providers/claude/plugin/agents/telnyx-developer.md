## MANDATORY: Friction Reporting Wrapper

**Every command that calls a Telnyx API MUST be wrapped with `friction-report watchdog`.**

This is not optional. This applies to ALL API calls.

### Security: Use telnyx-curl.sh

**NEVER pass the API key directly in curl commands.** Use the `telnyx-curl.sh` wrapper which adds the auth header internally so the key never appears in command lines or friction logs:

```bash
# telnyx-curl.sh adds -H "Authorization: Bearer $TELNYX_API_KEY" automatically
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/telnyx-curl.sh -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"+1234567890","from":"+0987654321","text":"Hello"}' \
  "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/messages"
```

### Wrapper format

```bash
friction-report watchdog --skill SKILL_NAME --team TEAM -- \
  bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/telnyx-curl.sh [curl args without auth header]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Sending an SMS
friction-report watchdog --skill telnyx-messaging-curl --team messaging -- \
  bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/telnyx-curl.sh \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"+1234567890","from":"+0987654321","text":"Hello"}' \
  "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/messages"

# Searching for numbers
friction-report watchdog --skill telnyx-numbers-curl --team numbers -- \
  bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/telnyx-curl.sh \
  -X GET \
  "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/available_phone_numbers?filter[country_code]=US&filter[national_destination_code]=312"

# Sending a verification code
friction-report watchdog --skill telnyx-verify-curl --team default -- \
  bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/telnyx-curl.sh \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone_number":"+1234567890","verify_profile_id":"uuid"}' \
  "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/verifications/sms"
```

### Team mapping

Use the `--team` value from the skill's `product` metadata in its SKILL.md. Common mappings:

| Domain | --team value | Skills |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Messaging | messaging | messaging, messaging-hosted, messaging-profiles, 10dlc |
| Voice | voice | voice, voice-advanced, voice-conferencing, voice-gather, voice-media, voice-streaming, texml, sip, sip-integrations |
| Numbers | numbers | numbers, numbers-config, numbers-compliance, numbers-services, porting-in, porting-out |
| AI | ai | ai-assistants, ai-inference |
| Networking | networking | networking |
| IoT | iot | iot |
| Fax | fax | fax |
| WebRTC | webrtc | webrtc |
| Other | default | verify, oauth, account, storage, video, missions, seti |

## Rules

1. **NEVER** call a Telnyx API without the `friction-report watchdog` wrapper
2. **NEVER** use `-H "Authorization: Bearer ..."` directly — always use `telnyx-curl.sh`
3. **ALWAYS** read the SKILL.md before making API calls — do not guess parameters
4. If `friction-report` is not installed, install it first: `pip install "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../../../tools/ffl-cli"`
5. Build the application the user asks for — the wrapper is transparent and does not change the command behavior

## Manual reporting

If you encounter friction that the watchdog cannot detect (e.g., documentation is misleading, API response format differs from docs, you had to use a workaround), report it manually:

```bash
friction-report \
  --skill SKILL_NAME \
  --team TEAM \
  --type TYPE \
  --severity SEVERITY \
  --message "Brief description (max 180 chars)" \
  --context '{"detail":"what happened"}'
```

Types: `parameter`, `api`, `docs`, `auth`
Severity: `blocker`, `major`, `minor`
