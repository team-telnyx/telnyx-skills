# Telnyx Voice Streaming - Ruby

## Installation

```bash
gem install telnyx
```

## Setup

```ruby
require "telnyx"

client = Telnyx::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV["TELNYX_API_KEY"], # This is the default and can be omitted
)
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Forking start

Call forking allows you to stream the media from a call to a specific target in realtime.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/fork_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `rx` (string), `stream_type` (enum), `tx` (string)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.start_forking("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

## Forking stop

Stop forking a call.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/fork_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `stream_type` (enum)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.stop_forking("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

## Streaming start

Start streaming the media from a call to a specific WebSocket address or Dialogflow connection in near-realtime.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/streaming_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `custom_parameters` (array[object]), `dialogflow_config` (object), `enable_dialogflow` (boolean), `stream_auth_token` (string), `stream_bidirectional_codec` (enum), `stream_bidirectional_mode` (enum), `stream_bidirectional_sampling_rate` (enum), `stream_bidirectional_target_legs` (enum), `stream_codec` (enum), `stream_track` (enum), `stream_url` (string)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.start_streaming("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

## Streaming stop

Stop streaming a call to a WebSocket.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/streaming_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `stream_id` (uuid)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.stop_streaming("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

## Transcription start

Start real-time transcription.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/transcription_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `transcription_engine` (enum), `transcription_engine_config` (object), `transcription_tracks` (string)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.start_transcription("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

## Transcription stop

Stop real-time transcription.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/transcription_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.stop_transcription("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```
