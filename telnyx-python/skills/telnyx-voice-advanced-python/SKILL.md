# Telnyx Voice Advanced - Python

## Installation

```bash
pip install telnyx
```

## Setup

```python
import os
from telnyx import Telnyx

client = Telnyx(
    api_key=os.environ.get("TELNYX_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Error Handling

All API calls can fail with network errors, rate limits (429), validation errors (422),
or authentication errors (401). Always handle errors in production code:

```python
import telnyx

try:
    result = client.messages.send(to="+13125550001", from_="+13125550002", text="Hello")
except telnyx.APIConnectionError:
    print("Network error — check connectivity and retry")
except telnyx.RateLimitError:
    # 429: rate limited — wait and retry with exponential backoff
    import time
    time.sleep(1)  # Check Retry-After header for actual delay
except telnyx.APIStatusError as e:
    print(f"API error {e.status_code}: {e.message}")
    if e.status_code == 422:
        print("Validation error — check required fields and formats")
```

Common error codes: `401` invalid API key, `403` insufficient permissions,
`404` resource not found, `422` validation error (check field formats),
`429` rate limited (retry with exponential backoff).

## Update client state

Updates client state

`PUT /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/client_state_update` — Required: `client_state`

```python
response = client.calls.actions.update_client_state(
    call_control_id="call_control_id",
    client_state="aGF2ZSBhIG5pY2UgZGF5ID1d",
)
print(response.data)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Send DTMF

Sends DTMF tones from this leg. DTMF tones will be heard by the other end of the call. **Expected Webhooks:**

There are no webhooks associated with this command.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/send_dtmf` — Required: `digits`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `duration_millis` (int32)

```python
response = client.calls.actions.send_dtmf(
    call_control_id="call_control_id",
    digits="1www2WABCDw9",
)
print(response.data)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## SIPREC start

Start siprec session to configured in SIPREC connector SRS. **Expected Webhooks:**

- `siprec.started`
- `siprec.stopped`
- `siprec.failed`

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/siprec_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `connector_name` (string), `include_metadata_custom_headers` (boolean), `secure` (boolean), `session_timeout_secs` (integer), `sip_transport` (enum: udp, tcp, tls), `siprec_track` (enum: inbound_track, outbound_track, both_tracks)

```python
response = client.calls.actions.start_siprec(
    call_control_id="call_control_id",
)
print(response.data)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## SIPREC stop

Stop SIPREC session. **Expected Webhooks:**

- `siprec.stopped`

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/siprec_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string)

```python
response = client.calls.actions.stop_siprec(
    call_control_id="call_control_id",
)
print(response.data)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Noise Suppression Start (BETA)

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/suppression_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `direction` (enum: inbound, outbound, both), `noise_suppression_engine` (enum: Denoiser, DeepFilterNet, Krisp), `noise_suppression_engine_config` (object)

```python
response = client.calls.actions.start_noise_suppression(
    call_control_id="call_control_id",
)
print(response.data)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Noise Suppression Stop (BETA)

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/suppression_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string)

```python
response = client.calls.actions.stop_noise_suppression(
    call_control_id="call_control_id",
)
print(response.data)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Switch supervisor role

Switch the supervisor role for a bridged call. This allows switching between different supervisor modes during an active call

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/switch_supervisor_role` — Required: `role`

```python
response = client.calls.actions.switch_supervisor_role(
    call_control_id="call_control_id",
    role="barge",
)
print(response.data)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Webhooks

### Webhook Verification

Telnyx signs webhooks with Ed25519. Each request includes `telnyx-signature-ed25519`
and `telnyx-timestamp` headers. Always verify signatures in production:

```python
# In your webhook handler (e.g., Flask — use raw body, not parsed JSON):
@app.route("/webhooks", methods=["POST"])
def handle_webhook():
    payload = request.get_data(as_text=True)  # raw body as string
    headers = dict(request.headers)
    try:
        event = client.webhooks.unwrap(payload, headers=headers)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Webhook verification failed: {e}")
        return "Invalid signature", 400
    # Signature valid — event is the parsed webhook payload
    print(f"Received event: {event.data.event_type}")
    return "OK", 200
```

The following webhook events are sent to your configured webhook URL.
All webhooks include `telnyx-timestamp` and `telnyx-signature-ed25519` headers for Ed25519 signature verification. Use `client.webhooks.unwrap()` to verify.
