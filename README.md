## Plugins and Extenstion

Install the unified Telnyx plugin to give your AI coding assistant Telnyx MCP server access and 228 Agent Skills covering messaging, voice, numbers, AI, IoT, WebRTC, Twilio migration, and more. 

Empowers coding agents to generate correct, production-ready code without relying on pre-training or fragile doc retrieval.

### Claude Code Plugin

**Step 1.** Add the Telnyx marketplace (one-time setup):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add team-telnyx/ai
```

**Step 2.** Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install telnyx@telnyx
```

### Gemini CLI extension

 ```sh
  gemini extensions install https://github.com/team-telnyx/ai
```

### Cursor                                                

> [!NOTE]
> Note: Our Cursor Marketplace listing is pending. 

In the meantime, install skills via the [Skills CLI](#agent-skills).

Add the Telnyx MCP server to your project's `.cursor/mcp.json`:                                                                                                
```json       
  {                                                         
    "mcpServers": {
      "telnyx": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
```

## Agent Toolkit

Integrate Telnyx APIs with popular agent frameworks through function calling — available in [Python](/tools/python) and [TypeScript](/tools/typescript).

### Python

```sh
pip install telnyx-agent-toolkit
```

```python
from telnyx_agent_toolkit.openai.toolkit import TelnyxAgentToolkit

toolkit = TelnyxAgentToolkit(
    api_key="KEY_...",
    configuration={
        "actions": {
            "messaging": {"send_sms": True},
            "numbers": {"search_phone_numbers": True, "buy_phone_number": True}
        }
    }
)

tools = toolkit.get_openai_tools()
```

Works with OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, and CrewAI. See [Python docs](/tools/python) for full usage and [examples](/tools/python/examples).

### TypeScript

```sh
npm install @telnyx/agent-toolkit
```

```typescript
import { TelnyxAgentToolkit } from "@telnyx/agent-toolkit/langchain";

const toolkit = new TelnyxAgentToolkit(process.env.TELNYX_API_KEY!, {
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      messaging: { send_sms: true },
      numbers: { search_phone_numbers: true, buy_phone_number: true },
    },
  },
});

const tools = toolkit.getLangChainTools();
```

Works with LangChain and Vercel's AI SDK. See [TypeScript docs](/tools/typescript) for full usage.
 for the full list of commands and options.

## Agent Skills

Install individual skills for your coding assistant via the [Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```sh
npx skills add team-telnyx/ai --skill <SKILL> --agent <AGENT>
```

> [!NOTE]
> See [Skills](/skills/README.md) for full install instrcuctions and comprehensive list of available skills


## Agent CLI

Composite commands that reduce multi-step Telnyx workflows to a single command. Built for AI agents and developers who want to provision infrastructure without orchestrating multiple API calls.

```sh
telnyx-agent setup-sms        # Buy number + create messaging profile + assign
telnyx-agent setup-voice       # Create SIP connection + buy number + assign
telnyx-agent setup-ai          # Create AI assistant + buy number + wire together
telnyx-agent setup-porting     # Check portability + create porting order + submit
telnyx-agent status            # Account health overview
```

Every command supports `--json` for machine-readable output.

See [Agent CLI](/cli)


## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Telnyx hosts a remote MCP server at `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/mcp`.

To run a local Telnyx MCP server using npx:

```sh
npx -y @telnyx/mcp --api-key=YOUR_TELNYX_API_KEY
```

See [MCP](/tools/mcp) for more details.

## Guides

Curl-first operational guides for common Telnyx workflows — SMS messaging, voice call control, AI assistants, phone numbers, porting, verification, webhooks, 10DLC registration, WireGuard networking, and x402 payments.

See [Guides](/guides) for the full list.
