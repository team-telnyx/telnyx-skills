# Telnyx Account Management - curl

## Installation

```text
# curl is pre-installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows 10+
```

## Setup

```bash
export TELNYX_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

All examples below use `$TELNYX_API_KEY` for authentication.

## Error Handling

All API calls can fail with network errors, rate limits (429), validation errors (422),
or authentication errors (401). Always handle errors in production code:

```bash
# Check HTTP status code in response
response=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" \
  -X POST "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TELNYX_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "+13125550001", "from": "+13125550002", "text": "Hello"}')

http_code=$(echo "$response" | tail -1)
body=$(echo "$response" | sed '$d')

case $http_code in
  2*) echo "Success: $body" ;;
  422) echo "Validation error — check required fields and formats" ;;
  429) echo "Rate limited — retry after delay"; sleep 1 ;;
  401) echo "Authentication failed — check TELNYX_API_KEY" ;;
  *)   echo "Error $http_code: $body" ;;
esac
```

Common error codes: `401` invalid API key, `403` insufficient permissions,
`404` resource not found, `422` validation error (check field formats),
`429` rate limited (retry with exponential backoff).

## Important Notes

- **Pagination:** List endpoints return paginated results. Use `page[number]` and `page[size]` query parameters to navigate pages. Check `meta.total_pages` in the response.
