```

## Add SSL Certificate

Uploads an SSL certificate and its matching secret so that you can use Telnyx's storage as your CDN.

`PUT /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```ruby
ssl_certificate = client.storage.buckets.ssl_certificate.create("")

puts(ssl_certificate)
```

## Remove SSL Certificate

## Get Bucket Usage

Returns the amount of storage space and number of files a bucket takes up.
