# Telnyx Voice Media - Ruby

## Installation

```bash
gem install telnyx
```

## Setup

```ruby
require "telnyx"

client = Telnyx::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV["TELNYX_API_KEY"], # This is the default and can be omitted
)
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Error Handling

All API calls can fail with network errors, rate limits (429), validation errors (422),
or authentication errors (401). Always handle errors in production code:

```ruby
begin
  result = client.messages.send_(to: "+13125550001", from: "+13125550002", text: "Hello")
rescue Telnyx::Errors::APIConnectionError
  puts "Network error — check connectivity and retry"
rescue Telnyx::Errors::RateLimitError
  # 429: rate limited — wait and retry with exponential backoff
  sleep(1) # Check Retry-After header for actual delay
rescue Telnyx::Errors::APIStatusError => e
  puts "API error #{e.status}: #{e.message}"
  if e.status == 422
    puts "Validation error — check required fields and formats"
  end
end
```

Common error codes: `401` invalid API key, `403` insufficient permissions,
`404` resource not found, `422` validation error (check field formats),
`429` rate limited (retry with exponential backoff).

## Play audio URL

the audio files will be placed in a queue awaiting playback. *Notes:*

## Webhooks

### Webhook Verification

Telnyx signs webhooks with Ed25519. Each request includes `telnyx-signature-ed25519`
and `telnyx-timestamp` headers. Always verify signatures in production:

```ruby
# In your webhook handler (e.g., Sinatra — use raw body):
post "/webhooks" do
  payload = request.body.read
  headers = {
    "telnyx-signature-ed25519" => request.env["HTTP_TELNYX_SIGNATURE_ED25519"],
    "telnyx-timestamp" => request.env["HTTP_TELNYX_TIMESTAMP"],
  }
  begin
    event = client.webhooks.unwrap(payload, headers)
  rescue => e
    halt 400, "Invalid signature: #{e.message}"
  end
  # Signature valid — event is the parsed webhook payload
  puts "Received event: #{event.data.event_type}"
  status 200
end
```

The following webhook events are sent to your configured webhook URL.
All webhooks include `telnyx-timestamp` and `telnyx-signature-ed25519` headers for Ed25519 signature verification. Use `client.webhooks.unwrap()` to verify.
