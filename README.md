## Agent Toolkit

Integrate Telnyx APIs with popular agent frameworks through function calling — available in [Python](/tools/python) and [TypeScript](/tools/typescript).

### Python

```sh
pip install telnyx-agent-toolkit
```

```python
from telnyx_agent_toolkit.openai.toolkit import TelnyxAgentToolkit

toolkit = TelnyxAgentToolkit(
    api_key="KEY_...",
    configuration={
        "actions": {
            "messaging": {"send_sms": True},
            "numbers": {"search_phone_numbers": True, "buy_phone_number": True}
        }
    }
)

tools = toolkit.get_openai_tools()
```

Works with OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, and CrewAI. See [Python docs](/tools/python) for full usage and [examples](/tools/python/examples).

### TypeScript

```sh
npm install @telnyx/agent-toolkit
```

```typescript
import { TelnyxAgentToolkit } from "@telnyx/agent-toolkit/langchain";

const toolkit = new TelnyxAgentToolkit(process.env.TELNYX_API_KEY!, {
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      messaging: { send_sms: true },
      numbers: { search_phone_numbers: true, buy_phone_number: true },
    },
  },
});

const tools = toolkit.getLangChainTools();
```

Works with LangChain and Vercel's AI SDK. See [TypeScript docs](/tools/typescript) for full usage.
 for the full list of commands and options.

## Agent Skills

Install individual skills for your coding assistant via the [Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```sh
npx skills add team-telnyx/ai --skill <SKILL> --agent <AGENT>
```

> [!NOTE]
> See [Skills](/skills/README.md) for full install instrcuctions and comprehensive list of available skills


## Agent CLI

Composite commands that reduce multi-step Telnyx workflows to a single command. Built for AI agents and developers who want to provision infrastructure without orchestrating multiple API calls.

```sh
telnyx-agent setup-sms        # Buy number + create messaging profile + assign
telnyx-agent setup-voice       # Create SIP connection + buy number + assign
telnyx-agent setup-ai          # Create AI assistant + buy number + wire together
telnyx-agent status            # Account health overview
```

Every command supports `--json` for machine-readable output.

See [Agent CLI](/cli)

## Plugins

Install the Telnyx plugin to give your AI coding assistant MCP server access and 228 Agent Skills covering messaging, voice, numbers, AI, IoT, WebRTC, Twilio migration, and more.

### Claude Code

 ```sh
  /plugin marketplace add team-telnyx/ai
  /plugin install telnyx@telnyx
```
### Gemini CLI

 ```sh
  gemini extensions install team-telnyx/ai
```

### Cursor                                                

```sh
  /add-plugin telnyx
```
Note: Cursor marketplace listing is pending. In the meantime, install skills via the [Skills CLI](#agent-skills).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Telnyx hosts a remote MCP server at `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/mcp`.

To run a local Telnyx MCP server using npx:

```sh
npx -y @telnyx/mcp --api-key=YOUR_TELNYX_API_KEY
```

See [MCP](/tools/mcp) for more details.

## Guides

Curl-first operational guides for common Telnyx workflows — SMS messaging, voice call control, AI assistants, phone numbers, verification, webhooks, 10DLC registration, WireGuard networking, and x402 payments.
