# Telnyx Voice Streaming - Ruby

## Installation

```bash
gem install telnyx
```

## Setup

```ruby
require "telnyx"

client = Telnyx::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV["TELNYX_API_KEY"], # This is the default and can be omitted
)
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Forking start

Call forking allows you to stream the media from a call to a specific target in realtime. This stream can be used to enable realtime audio analysis to support a 
variety of use cases, including fraud detection, or the creation of AI-generated audio responses. Requests must specify either the `target` attribute or the `rx` and `tx` attributes.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/fork_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `rx` (string), `stream_type` (enum: decrypted), `tx` (string)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.start_forking("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Forking stop

Stop forking a call. **Expected Webhooks:**

- `call.fork.stopped`

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/fork_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `stream_type` (enum: raw, decrypted)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.stop_forking("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Streaming start

Start streaming the media from a call to a specific WebSocket address or Dialogflow connection in near-realtime. Audio will be delivered as base64-encoded RTP payload (raw audio), wrapped in JSON payloads. Please find more details about media streaming messages specification under the [link](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/voice/programmable-voice/media-streaming).

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/streaming_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `custom_parameters` (array[object]), `dialogflow_config` (object), `enable_dialogflow` (boolean), `stream_auth_token` (string), `stream_bidirectional_codec` (enum: PCMU, PCMA, G722, OPUS, AMR-WB, L16), `stream_bidirectional_mode` (enum: mp3, rtp), `stream_bidirectional_sampling_rate` (enum: 8000, 16000, 22050, 24000, 48000), `stream_bidirectional_target_legs` (enum: both, self, opposite), `stream_codec` (enum: PCMU, PCMA, G722, OPUS, AMR-WB, L16, default), `stream_track` (enum: inbound_track, outbound_track, both_tracks), `stream_url` (string)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.start_streaming("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Streaming stop

Stop streaming a call to a WebSocket. **Expected Webhooks:**

- `streaming.stopped`

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/streaming_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `stream_id` (uuid)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.stop_streaming("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Transcription start

Start real-time transcription. Transcription will stop on call hang-up, or can be initiated via the Transcription stop command. **Expected Webhooks:**

- `call.transcription`

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/transcription_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `transcription_engine` (enum: Google, Telnyx, Deepgram, Azure, A, B), `transcription_engine_config` (object), `transcription_tracks` (string)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.start_transcription("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Transcription stop

Stop real-time transcription.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/transcription_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string)

```ruby
response = client.calls.actions.stop_transcription("call_control_id")

puts(response)
```

Returns: `result` (string)
