## Direct Replacements

| Twilio Product | Telnyx Equivalent | Migration Complexity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Programmable Voice (TwiML)** | **TeXML** | Low | XML verb-compatible. Swap endpoints + auth. Most TwiML works as-is. |
| **Programmable Voice (REST)** | **Call Control API** | Medium | Different paradigm: Telnyx uses event-driven WebSocket/webhook commands vs Twilio's REST calls. More granular control. |
| **Programmable Messaging** (SMS/MMS) | **Messaging API** | Medium | New SDK integration. Different payload structure. Same capabilities: SMS, MMS, long codes, toll-free, short codes. |
| **Elastic SIP Trunking** | **SIP Trunking** | Low | Direct replacement. Telnyx owns its network (not resold). Configure in Mission Control Portal. |
| **Voice SDK** (Client WebRTC) | **WebRTC SDKs** | Medium | SDKs for JS, iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native. Key difference: no mandatory backend server for tokens. |
| **Phone Numbers** | **Number Management** | Low | Licensed carrier with direct inventory in 140+ countries. Numbers managed via API or portal. |
| **Twilio Verify** | **Verify API** | Medium | 5 methods: SMS, vSMS (templated), Call, Flash Call, PSD2. Different API surface but same functionality. |
| **Twilio Lookup** | **Number Lookup** | Low | Carrier lookup, line type detection, caller name. Direct API replacement. |
| **Twilio Conversations** | No direct equivalent | N/A | Telnyx provides messaging primitives; no multi-channel conversation orchestration product. |
| **Twilio Notify** | No direct equivalent | N/A | Use Telnyx Messaging API directly for push/SMS notifications. |
| **10DLC Registration** | **10DLC Campaign Registry** | Low | Same underlying TCR system. Register brands and campaigns via Telnyx portal or API. |
| **Short Codes** | **Short Codes** | Low | Telnyx supports shared and dedicated short codes. |

## Telnyx-Only Products

| **AI Assistants** | Voice-capable AI assistants with built-in RAG (retrieval from storage buckets). Custom LLM providers (Azure, Bedrock). |
| **Embeddings API** | Text-to-vector embeddings as part of the Inference product. |
| **Cloud Storage** | S3-compatible object storage. Regional endpoints, bucket policies, migration tools from AWS S3. |
| **IoT SIM Cards** | Global IoT connectivity: eSIM, 650+ networks, 180+ countries, 2G through 4G LTE and CAT-M. |
| **Private Wireless Gateways** | VRF/MPLS-backed IoT networking off the public internet. |

| **Real-Time Transcription** | Native `<Transcription>` verb in TeXML for live STT during calls. Multiple engines: Google, Telnyx, Deepgram, Azure. |

## Twilio Products with No Telnyx Equivalent

If you depend on these, you will need a third-party alternative or custom solution:

| Twilio Product | Alternatives |
|---|---|
| **Flex** (Contact Center) | Build custom with Telnyx Call Control + WebRTC, or use third-party CCaaS |
| **Studio** (Visual Workflow Builder) | No equivalent. Use TeXML or Call Control API directly. |
| **Segment** (Customer Data Platform) | No equivalent. Consider Segment independently or alternatives (Rudderstack, mParticle). |
| **SendGrid** (Email) | No equivalent. Telnyx does not offer email. Use SendGrid independently or alternatives (Postmark, Resend, SES). |
| **TaskRouter** (Task Distribution) | No equivalent. Build custom routing with Call Control API queue management. |
| **Frontline** (deprecated by Twilio) | N/A |
| **Twilio Pay** | No equivalent. No `<Pay>` verb in TeXML. |
