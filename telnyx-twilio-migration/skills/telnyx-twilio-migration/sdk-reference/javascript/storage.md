# Telnyx Storage - JavaScript

## Installation

```bash
npm install telnyx
```

## Setup

```javascript
import Telnyx from 'telnyx';

const client = new Telnyx({
  apiKey: process.env['TELNYX_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Get Bucket SSL Certificate

Returns the stored certificate detail of a bucket, if applicable.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```javascript
const sslCertificate = await client.storage.buckets.sslCertificate.retrieve('');

console.log(sslCertificate.data);
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Add SSL Certificate

Uploads an SSL certificate and its matching secret so that you can use Telnyx's storage as your CDN.

`PUT /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```javascript
const sslCertificate = await client.storage.buckets.sslCertificate.create('');

console.log(sslCertificate.data);
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Remove SSL Certificate

Deletes an SSL certificate and its matching secret.

`DELETE /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```javascript
const sslCertificate = await client.storage.buckets.sslCertificate.delete('');

console.log(sslCertificate.data);
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Get API Usage

Returns the detail on API usage on a bucket of a particular time period, group by method category.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/usage/api`

```javascript
const response = await client.storage.buckets.usage.getAPIUsage('', {
  filter: { end_time: '2019-12-27T18:11:19.117Z', start_time: '2019-12-27T18:11:19.117Z' },
});

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `categories` (array[object]), `timestamp` (date-time), `total` (object)

## Get Bucket Usage

Returns the amount of storage space and number of files a bucket takes up.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/usage/storage`

```javascript
const response = await client.storage.buckets.usage.getBucketUsage('');

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `num_objects` (integer), `size` (integer), `size_kb` (integer), `timestamp` (date-time)

## Create Presigned Object URL

Returns a timed and authenticated URL to download (GET) or upload (PUT) an object. This is the equivalent to AWS S3’s “presigned” URL. Please note that Telnyx performs authentication differently from AWS S3 and you MUST NOT use the presign method of AWS s3api CLI or SDK to generate the presigned URL.

`POST /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/{objectName}/presigned_url`

Optional: `ttl` (integer)

```javascript
const response = await client.storage.buckets.createPresignedURL('', { bucketName: '' });

console.log(response.content);
```

Returns: `content` (object)
