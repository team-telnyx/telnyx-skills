# Telnyx Storage - Ruby

## Installation

```bash
gem install telnyx
```

## Setup

```ruby
require "telnyx"

client = Telnyx::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV["TELNYX_API_KEY"], # This is the default and can be omitted
)
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Get Bucket SSL Certificate

Returns the stored certificate detail of a bucket, if applicable.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```ruby
ssl_certificate = client.storage.buckets.ssl_certificate.retrieve("")

puts(ssl_certificate)
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Add SSL Certificate

Uploads an SSL certificate and its matching secret so that you can use Telnyx's storage as your CDN.

`PUT /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```ruby
ssl_certificate = client.storage.buckets.ssl_certificate.create("")

puts(ssl_certificate)
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Remove SSL Certificate

Deletes an SSL certificate and its matching secret.

`DELETE /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```ruby
ssl_certificate = client.storage.buckets.ssl_certificate.delete("")

puts(ssl_certificate)
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Get API Usage

Returns the detail on API usage on a bucket of a particular time period, group by method category.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/usage/api`

```ruby
response = client.storage.buckets.usage.get_api_usage(
  "",
  filter: {end_time: "2019-12-27T18:11:19.117Z", start_time: "2019-12-27T18:11:19.117Z"}
)

puts(response)
```

Returns: `categories` (array[object]), `timestamp` (date-time), `total` (object)

## Get Bucket Usage

Returns the amount of storage space and number of files a bucket takes up.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/usage/storage`

```ruby
response = client.storage.buckets.usage.get_bucket_usage("")

puts(response)
```

Returns: `num_objects` (integer), `size` (integer), `size_kb` (integer), `timestamp` (date-time)

## Create Presigned Object URL

Returns a timed and authenticated URL to download (GET) or upload (PUT) an object. This is the equivalent to AWS S3’s “presigned” URL. Please note that Telnyx performs authentication differently from AWS S3 and you MUST NOT use the presign method of AWS s3api CLI or SDK to generate the presigned URL.

`POST /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/{objectName}/presigned_url`

Optional: `ttl` (integer)

```ruby
response = client.storage.buckets.create_presigned_url("", bucket_name: "")

puts(response)
```

Returns: `content` (object)
