# Telnyx Voice Streaming - Java

## Installation

```text
// See https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-java for Maven/Gradle setup
```

## Setup

```java
import com.telnyx.sdk.client.TelnyxClient;
import com.telnyx.sdk.client.okhttp.TelnyxOkHttpClient;

TelnyxClient client = TelnyxOkHttpClient.fromEnv();
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Forking start

Call forking allows you to stream the media from a call to a specific target in realtime.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/fork_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `rx` (string), `stream_type` (enum), `tx` (string)

```java
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStartForkingParams;
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStartForkingResponse;

ActionStartForkingResponse response = client.calls().actions().startForking("call_control_id");
```

## Forking stop

Stop forking a call.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/fork_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `stream_type` (enum)

```java
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStopForkingParams;
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStopForkingResponse;

ActionStopForkingResponse response = client.calls().actions().stopForking("call_control_id");
```

## Streaming start

Start streaming the media from a call to a specific WebSocket address or Dialogflow connection in near-realtime.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/streaming_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `custom_parameters` (array[object]), `dialogflow_config` (object), `enable_dialogflow` (boolean), `stream_auth_token` (string), `stream_bidirectional_codec` (enum), `stream_bidirectional_mode` (enum), `stream_bidirectional_sampling_rate` (enum), `stream_bidirectional_target_legs` (enum), `stream_codec` (enum), `stream_track` (enum), `stream_url` (string)

```java
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStartStreamingParams;
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStartStreamingResponse;

ActionStartStreamingResponse response = client.calls().actions().startStreaming("call_control_id");
```

## Streaming stop

Stop streaming a call to a WebSocket.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/streaming_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `stream_id` (uuid)

```java
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStopStreamingParams;
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStopStreamingResponse;

ActionStopStreamingResponse response = client.calls().actions().stopStreaming("call_control_id");
```

## Transcription start

Start real-time transcription.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/transcription_start`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `transcription_engine` (enum), `transcription_engine_config` (object), `transcription_tracks` (string)

```java
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStartTranscriptionParams;
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStartTranscriptionResponse;
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.TranscriptionStartRequest;

ActionStartTranscriptionParams params = ActionStartTranscriptionParams.builder()
    .callControlId("call_control_id")
    .transcriptionStartRequest(TranscriptionStartRequest.builder().build())
    .build();
ActionStartTranscriptionResponse response = client.calls().actions().startTranscription(params);
```

## Transcription stop

Stop real-time transcription.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/transcription_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string)

```java
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStopTranscriptionParams;
import com.telnyx.sdk.models.calls.actions.ActionStopTranscriptionResponse;

ActionStopTranscriptionResponse response = client.calls().actions().stopTranscription("call_control_id");
```
