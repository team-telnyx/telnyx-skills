# Telnyx Storage - JavaScript

## Installation

```bash
npm install telnyx
```

## Setup

```javascript
import Telnyx from 'telnyx';

const client = new Telnyx({
  apiKey: process.env['TELNYX_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Error Handling

All API calls can fail with network errors, rate limits (429), validation errors (422),
or authentication errors (401). Always handle errors in production code:

```javascript
try {
  const result = await client.messages.send({ to: '+13125550001', from: '+13125550002', text: 'Hello' });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof Telnyx.APIConnectionError) {
    console.error('Network error — check connectivity and retry');
  } else if (err instanceof Telnyx.RateLimitError) {
    // 429: rate limited — wait and retry with exponential backoff
    const retryAfter = err.headers?.['retry-after'] || 1;
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, retryAfter * 1000));
  } else if (err instanceof Telnyx.APIError) {
    console.error(`API error ${err.status}: ${err.message}`);
    if (err.status === 422) {
      console.error('Validation error — check required fields and formats');
    }
  }
}
```

Common error codes: `401` invalid API key, `403` insufficient permissions,
`404` resource not found, `422` validation error (check field formats),
`429` rate limited (retry with exponential backoff).

## Get Bucket SSL Certificate

Returns the stored certificate detail of a bucket, if applicable.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```javascript
const sslCertificate = await client.storage.buckets.sslCertificate.retrieve('');

console.log(sslCertificate.data);
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Add SSL Certificate

Uploads an SSL certificate and its matching secret so that you can use Telnyx's storage as your CDN.

`PUT /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```javascript
const sslCertificate = await client.storage.buckets.sslCertificate.create('');

console.log(sslCertificate.data);
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Remove SSL Certificate

Deletes an SSL certificate and its matching secret.

`DELETE /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/ssl_certificate`

```javascript
const sslCertificate = await client.storage.buckets.sslCertificate.delete('');

console.log(sslCertificate.data);
```

Returns: `created_at` (date-time), `id` (string), `issued_by` (object), `issued_to` (object), `valid_from` (date-time), `valid_to` (date-time)

## Get API Usage

Returns the detail on API usage on a bucket of a particular time period, group by method category.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/usage/api`

```javascript
const response = await client.storage.buckets.usage.getAPIUsage('', {
  filter: { end_time: '2019-12-27T18:11:19.117Z', start_time: '2019-12-27T18:11:19.117Z' },
});

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `categories` (array[object]), `timestamp` (date-time), `total` (object)

## Get Bucket Usage

Returns the amount of storage space and number of files a bucket takes up.

`GET /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/usage/storage`

```javascript
const response = await client.storage.buckets.usage.getBucketUsage('');

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `num_objects` (integer), `size` (integer), `size_kb` (integer), `timestamp` (date-time)

## Create Presigned Object URL

Returns a timed and authenticated URL to download (GET) or upload (PUT) an object. This is the equivalent to AWS S3’s “presigned” URL. Please note that Telnyx performs authentication differently from AWS S3 and you MUST NOT use the presign method of AWS s3api CLI or SDK to generate the presigned URL. 

Refer to: https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/cloud-storage/presigned-urls

`POST /storage/buckets/{bucketName}/{objectName}/presigned_url`

Optional: `ttl` (integer)

```javascript
const response = await client.storage.buckets.createPresignedURL('', { bucketName: '' });

console.log(response.content);
```

Returns: `content` (object)
