# Telnyx Account Management - Python

## Installation

```bash
pip install telnyx
```

## Setup

```python
import os
from telnyx import Telnyx

client = Telnyx(
    api_key=os.environ.get("TELNYX_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Error Handling

All API calls can fail with network errors, rate limits (429), validation errors (422),
or authentication errors (401). Always handle errors in production code:

```python
import telnyx

try:
    result = client.messages.send(to="+13125550001", from_="+13125550002", text="Hello")
except telnyx.APIConnectionError:
    print("Network error — check connectivity and retry")
except telnyx.RateLimitError:
    # 429: rate limited — wait and retry with exponential backoff
    import time
    time.sleep(1)  # Check Retry-After header for actual delay
except telnyx.APIStatusError as e:
    print(f"API error {e.status_code}: {e.message}")
    if e.status_code == 422:
        print("Validation error — check required fields and formats")
```

Common error codes: `401` invalid API key, `403` insufficient permissions,
`404` resource not found, `422` validation error (check field formats),
`429` rate limited (retry with exponential backoff).

## Important Notes

- **Pagination:** List methods return an auto-paginating iterator. Use `for item in page_result:` to iterate through all pages automatically.

## Lists accounts managed by the current user.

Lists the accounts managed by the current user. Users need to be explictly approved by Telnyx in order to become manager accounts.
